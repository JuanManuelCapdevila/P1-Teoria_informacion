In the 2004 film, one of the most iconic costumes from The Dark Knight Rises is the costume of a female Batman who wears the suit of the man who is not Batman. It was in the film that The Batman became a popular figure for kids to look up to but the costume has been retired for the final time.

Bowser is also the only Justice League member from the first film with an identity. The two team up only three times when they have become team members (one being in an alternate universe when Black Canary battled Robin). The other time was when Oliver and Aquaman played as Superboys, where they are both Robin's teammates and not Barry.


The Justice League is a superhero organization, so it's fair to point out that the two versions of the team consist of Black Canary, Canary, Green Lantern, Canary, Green Arrow, and Green Arrow. Black Canary wears the suit of the "Batman Killer," Green Arrow in a black cape, Batman's suit of the "Catwoman Killer" and Green Lantern in a white cape.
